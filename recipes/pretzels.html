    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">This homemade pretzel recipe is great! After spending so much money on those mall pretzels,
        I thought I'd try making some myself. They are a bit sweeter than other types and are buttery.
        Dip the hot pretzel in melted butter and coat with your favorite flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C), or more as needed</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons active dry yeast
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup baking soda</li>
        <li>4 cups hot water</li>
        <li>¼ cup kosher salt, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Pour 1 ¼ cups warm water into a medium bowl. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, ½ cup sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add yeast mixture and oil. Mix well and form into a dough. If mixture is dry, add one or two more tablespoons of water.</li>
        <li>Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Pour 4 cups hot water into a large bowl. Stir in baking soda until dissolved; set aside.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape.</li>
        <li>Once all of the dough is shaped, dip each pretzel into the baking soda-hot water solution and place on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Devour!</li>
    </ol>
